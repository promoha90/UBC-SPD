; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Based on the two constants provided, write three expressions to determine whether: 
; 
; 1) IMAGE1 is taller than IMAGE2
; 2) IMAGE1 is narrower than IMAGE2
; 3) IMAGE1 has both the same width AND height as IMAGE2


(define IMAGE1 (rectangle 10 15 "solid" "red"))
(define IMAGE2 (rectangle 15 10 "solid" "red"))

(if (> (image-height IMAGE1) (image-height IMAGE2))
    "IMAGE1 is taller than IMAGE2"
    "IMAGE1 is shorter than IMAGE2")

(if (< (image-width IMAGE1) (image-width IMAGE2))
    "IMAGE1 is narrower than IMAGE2"
    "IMAGE1 is wider than IMAGE2")

(if (and (= (image-width IMAGE1) (image-width IMAGE2))
         (= (image-height IMAGE1) (image-height IMAGE2)))
    "IMAGE1 has both the same width AND height as IMAGE2"
    "IMAGE1 does not have the same width AND height as IMAGE2")
