; Problem: Design a function that pluralizes a given word.(Pluralize means to convert the word to
; its plural form.) For simplicity you may assume that just adding s is enough to pluralize a word.


;; String -> String

;; Produces a given word with an "s" added to the end.

(check-expect (pluralize "Cat") "Cats")
(check-expect (pluralize "Tortoise") "Tortoises")

; (define (pluralize s) " ") ; stub

#|(define (pluralize s)
    (... s))|#

(define (pluralize s)
  (string-append s "s"))
