; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a number and produces a blue solid triangle of that size.
; 
; You should use The How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe, and your complete design should include
; signature, purpose, commented out stub, examples/tests, commented out template and the completed function.

;; Natural -> Image
;; Produces a blue solid triangle given it's size.
;; Test cases
(check-expect (triangle_maker 20) (triangle 20 "solid" "blue"))
(check-expect (triangle_maker 0) (triangle 0 "solid" "blue"))
(check-expect (triangle_maker 70) (triangle 70 "solid" "blue"))

; (define (triangle_maker size) .)  ; stub (. should be an image, open this in DrRacket)

#| (define (triangle_maker size)    ; template
     (... size)|#

(define (triangle_maker size)
  (triangle size "solid" "blue"))
