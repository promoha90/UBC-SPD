; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; DESIGN a function called area that consumes the length of one side 
; of a square and produces the area of the square.
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.
; 


;; Natural -> Natural <- (An square's length cannot be negative)
;; Produces the area of a square given its length.
(check-expect (area 7) (* 7 7))
(check-expect (area -1) (* -1 -1))

; (define (area length) 0)  ; stub

#| (define (area length)    ; template
     (... length))|#

(define (area length)
  (* length length))
