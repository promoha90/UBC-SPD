; PROBLEM:
; 
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes a string, and adds "?" 
; to the end unless the string already ends in "?".
; 
; For this question, assume the string has length > 0. Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented 
; out versions of the stub and template.
; 

;; String -> String
;; Produces the given string adding a question mark to the end if not already at the END of the string.
;; Test cases
(check-expect (question "I have a Casio") "I have a Casio?")
(check-expect (question "Do you have a Casio?") "Do you have a Casio?")
(check-expect (question "Can you give me some? Thank you!") "Can you give me some? Thank you!?")
